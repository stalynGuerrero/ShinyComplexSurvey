Description: 
    Provides a tidyverse-oriented framework for the analysis of complex survey data.
    The package supports data ingestion from multiple formats, construction and
    diagnosis of complex survey designs, and estimation of basic survey statistics
    such as means, totals, and proportions with associated measures of uncertainty.
    It is designed as a reusable statistical backend that can be used programmatically
    or integrated into interactive applications built with Shiny.
